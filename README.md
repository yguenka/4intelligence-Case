<h1><b><p align="center">Data Analysis Skill Test</p></b></h1>
<p align="justify">In this repository there are 2 cases developed for the selection process of 4 intelligences for Data Scientist.</p>

## CASE 1
Using ` TFP.csv`:
<ol>
<li>Make an exploratory data analysis</li>
<dt>In the first, I did country data analysis as the image below.</dt>
<p align="center"><img src="Capturar1.JPG"></p>

<dt>And in the figure below, I made the plot by country to know if the data has any frequency.</dt>
<p align="center"><img src="Capturar2.JPG"></p>

<dt>We can conclude that Canada has a higher frequency value than other countries.</dt>

<li>Forecast 10 years of the series</li>
<li>Can you think about another feature that could be helpful in explaning TFP series? Explain</li>
</ol>
